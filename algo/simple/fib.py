  The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence
  is <span>0</span>, the second number is <span>1</span>, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th
  and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer
  <span>n</span> and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
</p>
<p>
  Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two
  numbers as <span>F0 = 0</span> and <span>F1 = 1</span>. For the purpose of
  this question, the first Fibonacci number is <span>F0</span>; therefore,
  <span>getNthFib(1)</span> is equal to <span>F0</span>, <span>getNthFib(2)</span>
  is equal to <span>F1</span>, etc..
