  Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum.
</p>
<p>
  A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either integers or other
  "special" arrays. The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its
  elements, where "special" arrays inside it are summed themselves and then
  multiplied by their level of depth.
</p>
<p>
  The depth of a "special" array is how far nested it is. For instance, the
  depth of <span>[]</span> is <span>1</span>; the depth of the inner array in
  <span>[[]]</span> is <span>2</span>; the depth of the innermost array in
  <span>[[[]]]</span> is <span>3</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, the product sum of <span>[x, y]</span> is <span>x + y</span>; the
  product sum of <span>[x, [y, z]]</span> is <span>x + 2 * (y + z)</span>; the
  product sum of <span>[x, [y, [z]]]</span> is <span>x + 2 * (y + 3z)</span>.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">array</span> = [5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>12 <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// calculated as: 5 + 2 + 2 * (7 - 1) + 3 + 2 * (6 + 3 * (-13 + 8) + 4)</span>
