        Write a function that takes in a list of unique strings and returns a list of
        semordnilap pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
        A semordnilap pair is defined as a set of different strings where the reverse
        of one word is the same as the forward version of the other. For example the
        words "diaper" and "repaid" are a semordnilap pair, as are the words
        "palindromes" and "semordnilap".
    </p>
    <p>
        The order of the returned pairs and the order of the strings within each pair
        does not matter.
    </p>
    <h3>Sample Input</h3>
    <pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">words</span> = ["diaper", "abc", "test", "cba", "repaid"]
</pre>
    <h3>Sample Output</h3>
    <pre>[["diaper", "repaid"], ["abc", "cba"]]</pre>
