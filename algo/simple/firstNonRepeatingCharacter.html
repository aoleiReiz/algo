        Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters
        and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that
        occurs only once.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function
        should return <span>-1</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>Sample Input</h3>
    <pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">string</span> = "abcdcaf"
</pre>
    <h3>Sample Output</h3>
    <pre>1 <span
            class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1.</span>
</pre>
