  <p>
    You're given a list of <span>edges</span> representing a connected,
    unweighted, undirected graph with at least one node. Write a function that
    returns a boolean representing whether the given graph is two-colorable.
  </p>

  <p>
    A graph is two-colorable (also called bipartite) if all of the nodes can
    be assigned one of two colors such that no nodes of the same color are
    connected by an edge.
  </p>

  <p>
    The given list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph.
    The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length of
    <span>edges</span>, where each index <span>i</span> in
    <span>edges</span> contains vertex <span>i</span>'s siblings, in no
    particular order. Each individual edge is represented by a positive integer
    that denotes an index in the list that this vertex is connected to. Note that
    this graph is undirected, meaning that if a vertex appears in the edge list
    of another vertex, then the inverse will also be true.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also note that this graph may contain self-loops. A self-loop is an edge that
    has the same destination and origin; in other words, it's an edge that
    connects a vertex to itself. Any self-loop should make a graph not
    2-colorable.
  </p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">edges</span> = [
  [1, 2],
  [0, 2],
  [0, 1]
]
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>False <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// Nodes 1 and 2 must be different colors than node 0.
// However, nodes 1 and 2 are also connected, meaning they must also have different colors,
// which is impossible with only 2 available colors.
